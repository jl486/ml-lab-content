Welcome! This course is a great place to start if you already have some background in machine learning. If not, we have an <Link href="/courses/intro-to-ml">introductory course</Link> too.

In the introductory course, you were under the pretense that a majority of data science and machine learning is building and analyzing models. But that is not the case. This course will be a bit more realistic. You'll learn to

* deal with real-world data with better **data cleaning** techniques
* improve model training with **data preprocessing**
* **create new features** that are easier for the model to learn
* use better methods for model validation
* train and predict using models used in practice
* find and avoid **data leakages**

You'll still be using the <Link href="/datasets/housing.csv" download>Ames housing dataset</Link>. Make sure to create a notebook or use the notebook you wrote in the previous course to follow along.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should feel comfortable with building a model (<Link href="/courses/intro-to-ml/your-first-ml-model#decision-trees">decision trees</Link> and <Link href="/courses/intro-to-ml/random-forests">random forests</Link>), evaluating its performance, and dealing with <Link href="/courses/intro-to-ml/underfitting-and-overfitting">underfitting and overfitting</Link>.
