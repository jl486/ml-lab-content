## Data leakage

When a model uses data that would not be available at the time of prediction. This causes the model to perform incredibly well on training or validation data but fail on predicting with unseen data.

Data leakages can happen during data preprocessing or improper train-test splits. It is often subtle since many leaky features look valid.
