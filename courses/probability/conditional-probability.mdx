**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event $A$ happening *given that* an event $B$ happened. It is written as $P(A | B)$.

## Definition

It is the ratio of the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring siultaneously and the probability of $B$:

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

## Independence

The events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A | B) = P(A)$.

## Bayes' theorem

Since $P(A \cap B) = P(A | B)P(B) = P(B | A)P(A)$ by the product rule, we can also write that

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Bayes' theorem can do many things that the definition of conditional probability by itself cannot. There's even an entire field of statistics about it (Bayesian statistics)!

A simple use case is reversing a conditional probability. For example, if you know $P(\text{positive test} | \text{disease})$ but want $P(\text{disease} | \text{positive test})$.

In <Link href="/glossary#supervised-learning">supervised learning</Link>, its used in the naive Bayes algorithm.

### Extended Bayes' theorem

Given a set of mutually-exclusive events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$, we have

$$
P(A_i | B) = \frac{P(B | A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_j P(B | A_j) P(A_j)}
$$

  <QuestionDescription>
    Let $A$ be the event of rolling an odd number on a die, and $B$ be the event of rolling a 3. Are $A$ and $B$ independent?

    <QuestionChoice>
      Yes
      <QuestionChoiceExplanation>
        Does the result being an odd number affect the probability of the result being 3?
      </QuestionChoiceExplanation>
    </QuestionChoice>
    <QuestionChoice correct>
      No
      <QuestionChoiceExplanation>
        Nice! We know that $P(A \cap B) = P(B)$ because 3 itself is an odd number, and we see that $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ is false.

    You toss a coin 3 times. Given that you got at least one heads, what's the probability of getting two heads in total?

      <QuestionChoiceExplanation>
        Let $A_1$ be the event where you get at least one heads and $A_2$ be the event where you get at least two heads. By going through the 8 possibilities for coin flips, you should get $P(A_1) = \frac{7}{8}$ and $P(A_2) = \frac{4}{8}$. Make sure you calculated $P(A_2 | A_1)$ correctly.

        Let $A_1$ be the event where you get at least one heads and $A_2$ be the event where you get at least two heads. By going through the 8 possibilities for coin flips, you should get $P(A_1) = \frac{7}{8}$ and $P(A_2) = \frac{4}{8}$. Make sure you calculated $P(A_2 | A_1)$ with the conditional probability definition.
