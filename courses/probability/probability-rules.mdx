Let's briefly go over some rules of probability.

Note that $P(A \cap B) = P(A, B)$, since sometimes equations are more clear with commas.

## Complement rule

The probability of event $A$ not happening is

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

We can prove this with the <Link href="/courses/probability/probability-axioms#second-axiom">second axiom</Link> of probability.

## Addition rule

Given events $A$ and $B$, if they are *mutually exclusive*, then we know from the <Link href="/courses/probability/probability-axioms#third-axiom">third axiom</Link> that

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

<Image src="/content/courses/05-probability/assets/addition.png" invert />

but if they are *not* mutually exclusive, then

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

because we are double-counting the probability of both events happening at the same time.

## Chain rule

Given events $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$, the probability of all the events happening at the same time is

$$
P(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2 | A_1)P(A_3 | A_2,A_1) \cdots P(A_n | A_{n-1}, \dots, A_1)
$$

The chain rule is a generalization of the product rule:

$$
P(A, B) = P(A | B)P(B)
$$

    Given events $A$ and $B$, if $P(A) = 0.41$, $P(B) = 0.53$, $P(A \cap B) = 0.20$, and $P(A^c \cap B^c) = 0.25$, what is the probability that only $A$ or only $B$ individually happens?

        The problem is essentially asking for $P((A \cup B) \cap (A \cap B)^c)$. Once you have $P(A \cup B)$, it will be straightforward.
