## Underfitting

When a model predicts poorly on both training and new data because it is too simple and can't capture important patterns in the data. These are some problems that cause underfitting:

* Problematic hyperparameters (such as too few leaf nodes in a <Link href="/glossary#decision-tree">decision tree</Link>)
* Too few iterations/epochs or to low a learning rate
