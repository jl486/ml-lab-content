## Normalization

The process of transforming data to be on the same range of values. Machine learning models usually make better predictions when features are normalized because all features are compared fairly.

These are a few common methods of normalization:

* <Link href="/glossary#robust-scaling">robust scaling</Link>: scaling using median and interquartile range to be robust to outliers
* <Link href="/glossary#min-max-scaling">min-max scaling</Link>: scaling values to a fixed range
