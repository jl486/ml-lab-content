## Min-max scaling

A <Link href="/glossary#scaling">scaling</Link> technique that rescales the values of a feature to be in a fixed range, usually $[0, 1]$.

The formula to transform a raw value $x_i$ in the feature $x$ to be in the range $[a, b]$ is

$$
x_i' = a + \frac{(x_i - \min(x))(b - a)}{\max(x) - \min(x)}
$$

where

* $x_i$ is the original value
* $x$ is the feature
* $x_i'$ is the new feature
