A type of <Link href="/glossary#categorical-feature">categorical variable</Link> where the categories have a natural, meaningful order, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily measurable.

* product quality: `poor`, `average`, `neutral`, `good`, `excellent`
* pain scale: numbers from 1-10
