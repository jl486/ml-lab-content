## Gradient

A vector of partial derivatives with respect to the indepepndence variables of a function. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function. 

If you have a function $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, the gradient is

$$
\nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \cdots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right)
$$
