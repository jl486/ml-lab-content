## Scaling

A transformation that changes the range of a numerical <Link href="/glossary#feature">feature</Link> or the shape of the feature's distribution. Scaling helps some algorithms, especially ones that rely on distances or gradients, work more efficiently because they won't be influenced by different scales.

These are a few common methods of scaling:

* <Link href="/glossary#z-score-standardization">z-score standardization</Link>: replaces the original value with the z-score, or the number of standard deviations from the mean
* <Link href="/glossary#robust-scaling">robust scaling</Link>: scaling using median and interquartile range to be robust to outliers
* <Link href="/glossary#min-max-scaling">min-max scaling</Link>: scaling values to a fixed range
* <Link href="/glossary#box-cox-transformation">Box-Cox transformation</Link>: normality transformations
