## Mean absolute error

The average distances between the true value and the predicted value. Mean absolute error (MAE) is often used in <Link href="/glossary#regression-model">regression</Link> problems.

Mathematically, MAE is defined as

$$
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lvert y_i - \hat{y}_i \rvert
$$

* $y$ are the true values
* $\hat{y}$ are the predictions
* $n$ is the total amount of data points
* $i$ is the index
