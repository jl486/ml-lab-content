## One-hot encoding

A technique to represent categorical data as a binary vector (list of ones and zeros).

* It creates a new binary column for each category in the original feature
* Each row has a `1` in the column corresponding to its category and a `0` in the rest of the categories

For example, this is how `color` is encoded if its possible values are `red`, `green`, and `blue`:
