## Z-score standardization

A <Link href="/glossary#scaling">scaling</Link> technique that transforms features so that they have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is done by replacing each value in a feature with its z-score.

The z-score of a raw value $x$ is calculated like this:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
