In this lesson, we'll review the 3 axioms of probability. An **axiom** in mathematics is something that is accepted to be true so we have somewhere to build off of (to make theorems, for example).

## First axiom

The probability of any event $A$ is between 0 and 1, inclusive.

$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
$$

## Second axiom

The probability of at least one of the events in a *sample space* $S$ is 1. The **sample space** contains all the possible outcomes of an experiment.

$$
P(S) = 1
$$

## Third axiom

If the events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are *mutually exclusive* (can't happen at the same time), then the probability of any of those events happening is the sum of their probabilities.

$$
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \cdots + P(A_n)
$$
